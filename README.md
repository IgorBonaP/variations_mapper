# variations_mapper
Python notebook (to be run in vscode) to generate chromosomal maps of mutations.
This program was developed for personal during my PhD to map alleles isolated in an unbiased mutagenic screen using C. elegans.
It targets genomic variations calls .csv files generated by GeneWiz (in 2020).
I have not tested this code in platforms other than win10.
Parameters are easily adaptable for other .csv file structures, feel free to use it.
Email me if you have any questions or feedback.

Cheers,

Igor
